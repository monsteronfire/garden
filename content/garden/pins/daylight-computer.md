## Reason to bookmark

I've been on a bit of a journey, recently, focused on finding more sustainable ways to live as a modern human. Sometimes it feels nearly impossible to opt-out of internet culture and the computing ecosystems I've become entrenched in. So I'm bookmarking Daylight to see where it goes.

From their website:

> The vision for Daylight is to build a whole ecosystem of healthier, more humane computers that respect our health, attention, and freedom.
