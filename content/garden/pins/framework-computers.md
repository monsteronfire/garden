## Reason to bookmark

I think I'd like to get a Framework laptop as my next machine. The modular approach really appeals to me.

Plus, I hate planned obsolescence. Most of us aren't flush with cash to be able to get a new computer every few years, so I think it's ethical to have the right to repair.

Also, the colours are very nice.
