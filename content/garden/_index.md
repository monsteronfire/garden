A hypertext garden is a collection of ideas in various stages of completion. In my garden, my thoughts take the form of notes, essays, pins, portraits, and projects.

Some of these may be initial [seeds](/growth_stage/seed) of a concept, others may develop into [sprouts](/growth_stage/sprout), and hopefully a few will [bloom](/growth_stage/bloom) into something more substantial.

Like in the physical world, the practice of gardening is a continuous labour of love. My hope is that my garden will continue to grow and change as I continue to grow and change.

Now pick a card, any card.
