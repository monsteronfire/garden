I follow threads of curiosity all over the internet and use this garden to document and grow my understanding.

While writing code is my main outlet for creativity, I dabble in many interests, including [digital illustration](/garden/portraits), [content creation](/tags/content-creation), social media marketing, [community](/tags/community) building, [tooling](/garden/experiments), real-life crafts, and various other pursuits.

Right now, I'm learning [Elixir](/tags/elixir)/[Phoenix](/tags/phoenix) and exploring how [offline models](/tags/ollama) can be used to build secure [internal tools](/tags/tool).
